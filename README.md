This is a simple web application that helps users determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.

I built this project some time ago, and now I'm on a streak of uploading my projects to GitHub. This is one of them

## Explanation of Leap Year

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. In simpler terms, a leap year occurs every 4 years, but century years (e.g., 1900, 2000, 2100) are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400.

## How to Use

1. **Enter the Year**: Input the year you want to check in the input box provided.
2. **Click "Submit"**: Once you've entered the year, click on the "Submit" button.
3. **Result**: The application will display whether the entered year is a leap year or not.

## How to Calculate

To determine if a year is a leap year:

- If the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400, it is not a leap year.
